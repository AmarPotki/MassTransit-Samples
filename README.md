## What is MassTransit?

MassTransit is an open-source distributed application framework for .NET that simplifies the development of message-based applications. It provides a set of abstractions and tools for building distributed systems using messaging patterns such as publish-subscribe, request-response, and message routing.

Some of the key features of MassTransit include:
- Support for multiple transport protocols, including RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, and Amazon SQS
- Built-in support for popular .NET dependency injection frameworks, including Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection and Autofac
- Integration with popular .NET logging frameworks, including Serilog and NLog
- A rich set of abstractions and tools for building message-based applications, including message consumers, sagas, and routing slips

## Sample applications

This repository contains a set of sample applications that demonstrate how to use MassTransit to build message-based applications. The samples cover a range of scenarios, from simple message producers and consumers to more complex scenarios such as sagas and message routing.

The following samples are included in this repository:
- Hello World: a simple console application that demonstrates how to use MassTransit to send and receive messages
- Request-Response: a console application that demonstrates how to use MassTransit to implement a request-response pattern
- Publish-Subscribe: a console application that demonstrates how to use MassTransit to implement a publish-subscribe pattern
- Sagas: a console application that demonstrates how to use MassTransit to implement a saga pattern
- Routing Slip: a console application that demonstrates how to use MassTransit to implement a routing slip pattern
- MassTransit with ASP.NET Core: an ASP.NET Core sample application that demonstrates how to use MassTransit to build a message-based application

## How to run the sample applications

To run the sample applications, you will need to have .NET Core SDK 7 or later installed on your machine. You will also need to have a message broker installed and running. The samples in this repository are configured to use RabbitMQ by default, but you can easily switch to another transport protocol by updating the configuration files.

To run a sample application, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the directory of the sample application you want to run
3. Run the following command to build the application: `dotnet build`
4. Run the following command to start the application: `dotnet run`

Each sample application is designed to run indefinitely, so you can leave it running and send messages to it as needed.

## Conclusion

MassTransit is a powerful framework for building message-based applications, and this repository contains a set of sample applications that demonstrate its capabilities. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue in this repository.
